# Sample Hardhat Project

#### This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


We are writing a simple program that allows us to deploy a smart contract via Hardhat framework, veryfin it on a real test net and then interact with it.

npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
